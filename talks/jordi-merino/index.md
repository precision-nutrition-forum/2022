![](/images/speakers/jordi-merino.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} Dr. Merino's research interests span nutrition, metabolism, and genomics, all aimed at understanding how molecular and environmental factors affect complex metabolic diseases to identify more effective, tailored, and sustainable strategies for preventing diabetes and related complications. A major research interest is genetic determinants of food intake, which provided insights into central nervous system processes regulating appetite and metabolic homeostasis. Dr. Merino has designed and implemented clinical trials to predict individual responses to specific dietary interventions.
