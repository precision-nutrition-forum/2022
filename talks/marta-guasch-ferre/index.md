![](/images/speakers/marta-guasch-ferre.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} Dr. Guasch-Ferré's research focuses on investigating the role of dietary and lifestyle factors in chronic diseases, specifically cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. She has incorporated high-throughput –omics techniques, metabolomics, and genetics, into traditional epidemiological analysis to gain insights into underlying mechanisms that could explain the associations of diet and lifestyle factors with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
