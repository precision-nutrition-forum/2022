![](/images/speakers/carl-brunius.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} Dr. Brunius investigates how diet associates to health outcomes via metabolic regulation, against a backdrop of multiple exposures, including microbiota, lifestyle and organic pollutants. He also develops approaches for precision nutrition, i.e., healthy food tailored for individual requirements. For this purpose, he aims at discovering metabotypes, i.e., groups of individuals with similar metabolic regulation in relation to diet, and to understand what determines such metabotypes. A major research interest lies in developing and applying molecular epidemiological approaches for linking multiple exposures to multiple health outcomes via molecular mediators. His research relies on machine learning and Omics data from both cohort and intervention studies.
