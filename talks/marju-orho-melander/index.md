![](/images/speakers/marju-orho-melander.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} With main focus in cardiometabolic diseases, Dr Orho-Melander has successfully moved to new areas of research during her career starting with experimental endocrinology and moving to genetic epidemiology, nutrition epidemiology and gene-diet interaction studies, and today utilizing and combining this interdisciplinary prior knowledge in studies of the gut microbiome, diet and circulating biomarkers in large population-based cohorts. The longer-term purpose of the work of Orho-Melanders group is to provide novel intervention strategies aiming to more effective prevention strategies of cardiometabolic diseases.
