![](/images/speakers/andrew-t-chan.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} Dr. Chan's research focuses on chronic digestive diseases, including gastrointestinal cancer (colorectal, esophageal, pancreatic), inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He utilizes molecular approaches encompassing genetic, metabolomic, proteomic, and biochemical platforms applied to populations ranging from large cohort studies to small biomarker-driven clinical trials. He also has a major effort in investigating the oral and gut microbiome as a determinant and mediator of chronic disease.
