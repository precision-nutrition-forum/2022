His work has contributed substantially to current public health policies for global chronic disease prevention. In addition, his research has broken new ground in linking novel biomarkers (e.g., adipokines and metabolites) and gene-diet interactions to the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Dr. Hu has been at the forefront of applying metabolomics techniques to nutritional epidemiologic studies and intervention trials. Currently, he serves as the PI of Dietary Biomarker Development Center at Harvard University
