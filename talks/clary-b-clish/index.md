![](/images/speakers/clary-b-clish.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} Our work focuses on the development and application of technologies for the systematic analysis of metabolites in biological specimens. The potential of metabolomics to detect and characterize early metabolic changes in subclinical disease has important implications for discovering pathophysiologic mechanisms and disease markers. We also use metabolomics to understand the molecular mechanisms through which diet, exercise, and the microbiome affect human health.
