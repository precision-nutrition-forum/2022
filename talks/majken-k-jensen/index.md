![](/images/speakers/majken-k-jensen.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} Dr. Jensen's primary research fields include the identification of aging-related chronic diseases biomarkers (fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular, cognitive impairment, dementia); investigation of high-dimensional data (genome-wide association studies, proteomics, and other -omics) in observational epidemiology; and advancement of methodological approaches for the epidemiological investigation of biomarkers in chronic diseases. Her research team also works on combining national data registries with biomarkers and images from a tissue biobank estimate prognosis and reclassify (biopsy-proven) diseases.
