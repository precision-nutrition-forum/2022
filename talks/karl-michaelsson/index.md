He is the principal investigator of SIMPLER, a Swedish national research infrastructure (https://simpler4health.se/). This national infrastructure, initiated in 1987, includes information about 110,000 men and women, a biobank with DNA, blood, urine, fat biopsy, and stool samples, and a growing component of OMICs data. Over the years, the participants have undergone repeated examinations, and the SIMPLER database has been regularly updated against national registries.
