![](/images/speakers/shilpa-n-bhupathiraju.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} Dr. Bhupathiraju's primary research interests include examining the role of diet and lifestyle in preventing cardiometabolic diseases, especially among high-risk groups such as Hispanics and South Asians. Her research integrates diet, metabolomics, and proteomics data in prospective cohort studies to understand mechanisms underlying diet-disease associations and to identify novel biomarkers of dietary intake.
