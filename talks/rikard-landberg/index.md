![](/images/speakers/rikard-landberg.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} Dr. Landberg studies the preventive role of plant-based foods using observational- and intervention studies integarating OMICs techniques. Metabolomics is a key technique in Dr. Landbergs' research program and it is developed and applied for discovery and validation of exposure and prediction biomarkers, and for molecular phenotyping as the basis for tailored dietary strategies towards precision nutrition. Novel biomarkers from his lab are extensively used all over the world.
