![](/images/speakers/ann-sofie-sandberg.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} Dr Sandberg has focused her research during the last 30 -40 years on bioavailability of minerals and inhibitors of absorption as well as bioactive compounds in seafood of importance in metabolic disease. In recent years she has become interested in early life nutrition and has together with national colleagues established a mother child birth cohort (NICE) in the North of Sweden. The cohort is designed to investigate the influence of lifestyle factors during pregnancy and early in life on immune maturation and allergy development in the children. Dr Sandberg studies the effect of diet and nutrients, validated with biomarkers, on immune maturation and allergy outcome in the children applying metabolomics and other omics techniques. Dr Sandberg is elected member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Engineering Sciences, honorary doctor in medicine at Sahlgrenska Academy, vice chair of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences National Committee of Nutrition and Food Science, holder of the Gustaf Dal√©n memorial medal. Currently, Dr Sandberg is leading a research group at Division of Food and Nutrition Science at Chalmers.
