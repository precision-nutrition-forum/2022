He is head of the Physiology Group at Wallenberg Laboratory and senior consultant in clinical physiology at the Vascular Diagnostic Unit, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. He is chair of the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS), which aims to recruit and extensively phenotype 30,000 subjects aged 50-64 years at six Swedish university hospitals. The ultimate goal of SCAPIS is to reduce mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and related metabolic disorders.
