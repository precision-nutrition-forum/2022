![](/images/speakers/jessica-lasky-su.png){style="float: left; padding: 20px; border-radius: 30px; width: 120px"} Dr. Lasky-Su is an Associate Professor in Medicine and Associate Statistician and Epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Over two decades, Dr. Lasky-Su has focused on the analysis of genetics, genomics, and metabolomics data in large scale human studies, with a primary research focus on lung disease pathophysiology. The accumulation of these efforts has resulted in a productive track record of over 200 original research articles. Via multiple PI-funded grants, Dr. Lasky-Su has particularly focused her research on &quot;integrative metabolomics,&quot; that integrates multiomic data while using a metabolomic-centric framework. Dr. Lasky-Su is also a leader in national and international metabolomic organizations for metabolomics, including the President of the Metabolomics Society-the largest International society for metabolomics, in the chairman of the NIH's Consortium of METabolomic Studies (COMETS)-the largest international consortium of metabolomic epidemiological studies.
