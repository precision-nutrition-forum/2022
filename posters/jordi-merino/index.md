**Background:**

Prior research has identified genetic variants influencing macronutrient
preference, but whether genetic predisposition to carbohydrate, fat, or
protein preference is associated with food choice behavior is unknown.
Here, we examined the associations of polygenic scores for carbohydrate,
fat, and protein preference with workplace food purchases.

**Method:**

We conducted a secondary analysis of baseline data from 397 hospital
employees enrolled in the ChooseWell 365 trial. Hospital cafeterias
labeled all food and beverages with traffic light labels (green=healthy,
red=unhealthy). Participants’ cafeteria purchases were obtained
retrospectively for the 12 months before study enrollment. Participants’
genetic predisposition to macronutrient preference was characterized
using polygenic scores for carbohydrate, fat, and protein preference.
Linear mixed-effect models were used to estimate the association between
polygenic scores and the number and quality of cafeteria purchases.

**Results:**

Participants were mostly female (n=321, 80.9%) with a median age of 45
(IQR, 33 to 56) and median BMI of 26.5 (IQR, 23.5 to 30.8 kg/m2). There
were 215,692 cafeteria purchases over 12 months. Each SD increase in
thepolygenic score for carbohydrate preference was associated with 2.3
additional purchases/month (95%CI, 0.2 to 4.3; p=0.03), and a higher
number of green-labeled purchases (b=1.9, 95%CI, 0.5 to 3.3; p=0.01).
There were no associations between fat and protein polygenic scores with
cafeteria purchases.

**Conclusions:**

Genetic predisposition to carbohydrate preference, but not fat or
protein, was associated with higher numbers of both total and
green-labeled purchases. These preliminary findings suggest that genetic
differences in food preferences may influence employees’ responses to
workplace healthy eating efforts, such as cafeteria traffic light
labels.
