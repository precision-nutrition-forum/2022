Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the most common cause of death
worldwide.Randomized controlled trials (RCT) have shown that marine
omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of CVD, although inconsistent
findings exist.The beneficial effects are predominantly mediated through
the lowering of fasting triglycerides (TG) levels. Non-fasting TG levels
are a significant risk factor for CVD, and omega-3 intake has been shown
to affect postprandial TG levels. However, little is known about the
inter-individual variation in the postprandial TG response after omega-3
fatty acids supplementation and the mechanisms. Thus, this trial aims to
elucidate how omega-3 fatty acids supplementation affects postprandial
lipid and inflammatory responses after a high-fat meal in healthy
overweight subjects. We will perform a novel clinical trial in two
phases: In which the first phase will be a classical RCT followed by a
meal response. The participants will either take a control oil or 2g/d
of marine omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil for six weeks with a 12-week
wash-out period before changing the intervention. Before and after each
treatment period, the fasted participants will be served a high-fat
mixed meal containing 60 g of butter. Lipids, glucose, insulin and
inflammatory markers, and PBMC gene expression, will be measured during
the postprandial period, which last for 8 h. After the classical RCT,
all participants will be supplemented with 2 g/d of marine omega-3 fatty
acids for six weeks after a 12-week wash-out period followed by the meal
response. This repeated exposure period offers the opportunity to define
omega-3 responders and non-responders to understand individual variation
in post-prandial TG levels better. We aim to recruit 52 healthy
overweight male and female participants with fasting TG in the normal
range (1-1.7 mmol/L). To better understand individual fasting and
postprandial TG response, body composition, genetics, habitual dietary
intake, chrono-nutrition, continuous glucose measurements, and physical
activity will be determined before each visit. In addition, for future
analyses, fecal samples will be collected for microbiota analyses and
plasma for untargeted metabolomics analyses. This study seeks to
generate new knowledge in precision nutrition to understand better why
some people respond better to omega-3 fatty acids than others.
