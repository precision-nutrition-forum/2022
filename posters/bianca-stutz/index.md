**Background:**

Hunger and glucose homeostasis follow a circadian rhythmicity and might
differ by their circadian phenotype, e.g. chronotype, particularly when
consuming a meal with a high glycaemic index (GI). As young adults are
vulnerable for dietary misalignment, this study investigates whether i)
morning versus evening 2-hour post-prandial (2-h pp) glycaemic response
to a high GI meal differs among earlier and later chronotypes, and
whether ii) the chronotype is associated with circadian differences in
hunger\*.&lt;/I&gt;

**Methods:**

Among 320 students aged 18-25 years those with the earliest (n=22) and
latest (n=23) chronotype were invited to a randomized controlled
cross-over nutrition trial. On the intervention days, participants
received a high GI meal (GI=72) either in the morning (7 a.m.) or the
evening (8 p.m.). All other meals had a medium GI (46-59). Glucose
responses were recorded by a continuous glucose monitoring device.
Hunger was estimated on a labelled magnitude scale. Paired T-Test was
used to compare 2-h pp incremental area under the curve (iAUC), and
differences in hunger before meal intake (morning vs. evening). The
association between hunger and chronotype was analysed using
multivariable linear regression.

**Results:**

Earlier chronotypes (mid-point of sleep 3:43 a.m.) showed higher 2-h pp
iAUC responses in the evening than in the morning: iAUC 236 (±90)
vs. 198 (± 87) mmol/L, p=0.04, while in later chronotypes (5:37 a.m.)
responses were comparable: iAUC 213 (±112) vs. 208 (±96) mmol/L, p=0.96.
Hunger was higher in the evening than in the morning (p&lt;0.0001) but
this difference was not associated with the chronotype (p=0.7). 

**Conclusion:**

While glucose homeostasis deteriorated in earlier chronotypes over the
day, later chronotypes showed similar glucose responses to a high GI
meal consumed early in the morning and late in the evening. This
suggests that glucose homeostasis among later chronotypes may be
adversely affected also early in the morning following a high GI meal
against the inner clock. The circadian rhythm of hunger seems to be
independent of the chronotype.
